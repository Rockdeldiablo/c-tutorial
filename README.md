# c-tutorial
c tutorial based on the book  "Modern C" by Jens Gustedt

the project is as simple as it sound: i plan to  re-learn the C language in the upcoming months by starting from scratch.
i will follow Jens gustedt's book  and i will try to upload new material as i progress through the chapters.
