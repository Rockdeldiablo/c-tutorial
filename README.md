# c-tutorial
c tutorial based on the book  "C programming: Absolute beginner's guide" by Greg Perry and Dean Miller

the project is as simple as it sound: i plan to  re-learn the C language in the upcoming months by starting from scratch.
i will follow Perry and Miller's book  and i will try to upload new material as i progress through the chapters.
